    "## Creating Model in gurobipy\n",
    "Gurobi Python applications should always start with this line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from gurobipy import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first step in our example is to create a model. A Gurobi model holds a single optimization\n",
    "problem. It consists of a set of variables, a set of constraints, and the associated attributes (variable\n",
    "bounds, objective coefficients, variable integrality types, constraint senses, constraint right-hand\n",
    "side values, etc.). We start this example with an empty model object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = Model(\"mip1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Adding Variable\n",
    "Adding variables to the model\n",
    "The next step in our example is to add variables to the model.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.BINARY, name=\"x\")\n",
    "y = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.BINARY, name=\"y\")\n",
    "z = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.BINARY, name=\"z\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variables are added through the\n",
    "addVar()\n",
    "method on a model object (or\n",
    "addVars()\n",
    "if you wish\n",
    "to add more than one at a time). A variable is always associated with a particular model.\n",
    "Python allows you to pass arguments by position or by name. Weâ€™ve passed them by name here.\n",
    "Each variable gets a type (binary), and a name. We use the default values for the other arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    " Model.addVar()\n",
    "addVar ( lb=0.0, ub=GRB.INFINITY, obj=0.0, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, name=\"\", column=None )\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a decision variable to a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments:\n",

    "lb (optional): Lower bound for new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "ub (optional): Upper bound for new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "obj (optional): Objective coefficient for new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "vtype (optional): Variable type for new variable (GRB.CONTINUOUS, GRB.BINARY, GRB.INTEGER, GRB.SEMICONT, or GRB.SEMIINT).\n",
    "\n",
    "name (optional): Name for new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Objective\n",
    "Model.setObjective()\n",
    "setObjective ( expr, sense=None )\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the model objective equal to a linear or quadratic expression. (For multi-objective optimization see setObjectiveN.)\n",
    "Note that you can also modify a linear model objective using the Obj variable attribute. If you wish to mix and match these two approaches, please note that this method will replace the existing objective.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.setObjective(x + y, GRB.MAXIMIZE)\n",
    "model.setObjective(x + 2*y, GRB.MINIMIZE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Constraint\n",
    "The next step in the example is to add the linear constraints. The first constraint is added here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add constraint: x + 2 y + 3 z <= 4\n",
    "m.addConstr(x + 2 * y + 3 * z <= 4, \"c0\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "As with variables, constraints are always associated with a specific model. They are created using\n",
    "the\n",
    "addConstr()\n",
    "method on the model object.\n",
    "We again use overloaded arithmetic operators to build linear expressions. The comparison operators\n",
    "are also overloaded to make it easier to build constraints.\n",
    "The second argument to\n",
    "addConstr\n",
    "gives the (optional) constraint name.\n",
    "Again, this simple example builds the linear expression for the constraint in a single statement using\n",
    "an explicit list of terms. More complex programs will typically build the expression incrementally.\n",

Rather, they are transformed by presolve into mathematically equivalent sets of constraints (and variables), chosen from among the fundamental types listed above. These general constraints are provided as a convenience to users. If such constraints appear in your model, but if you prefer to reformulate them yourself using fundamental constraint types instead, you can certainly do so. However, note that Gurobi can sometimes exploit information contained in the other constraints in the model to build a more efficient formulation than what you might create.\n",

    "The additional constraint types that fall under this general constraint umbrella are:\n",
    "1. MAX (addGenConstrMax): set a decision variable equal to the maximum value from among a set of decision variables\n",
    "2. MIN (addGenConstrMin): set a decision variable equal to the minimum value from among a set of decision variables  \n",
    "3. ABS (addGenConstrAbs): set a decision variable equal to the absolute value of some other decision variable\n",
    "4. AND (addGenConstrAnd): set a binary variable equal to one if and only if all of a set of binary decision variables are equal to one\n",
    "5. OR (addGenConstrOr): set a binary variable equal to one if and only if at least one variable out of a set of binary decision variables is equal to one\n",
    "6. INDICATOR (addGenConstrIndicator): whenever a given binary variable takes a certain value, then the given linear constraint must be satisfied\n",

    "model.addGenConstrIndicator(x7, True, x1 + 2*x2 + x4 == 1.0)\n",
